# TODOs

In this file I collect ideas, tasks and improvement ideas for the Dotfiles project.

- Ability to verify if a stack set is operational (status? version? verify?)
- Easy AWS Profile selector
- Prompt indicates current AWS profile
- alias to log into AWS.
- Rename files in ~/.config/zshrc.d, use a zsh-specific extension.
